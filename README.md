**1. How do I approach designing software?**
My approach to software design is more linear than anything else. I first look over the requirements and make lists from most to least difficult. This helps ne to determine where the majority of my time will be spent working, and what I can wait a bit longer on.
My next step is simply working down that list, knocking off my list from the top down. If I ever get to a point where I absolutely CANNOT proceed, I will move down the list while I wait for any questions I may have to be answered, only to circle back once informed.
In my belief, this way of work has really helped me do a better job at completing assignments rather than working down the list of requirements as written in each description of work.

**2. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
This class has truly opened my eyes as to the possibilities of computational graphics. I did not even know how to begin when this class started, and to see the work I had accomplished in 8 weeks blew me away. If anything, this course has pushed my mind into diving
deeper into graphics and learning how to master this craft as a future profession. Learning how to develop and create lighting for scenes, how to texture onbjects and even create my own textures was an eye opener for myself. Something I had never understood, but now
have walked away with at least a beginner level of knowledge to continue to build on.
